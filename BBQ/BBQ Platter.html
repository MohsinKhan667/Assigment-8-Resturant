            <h1>BBQ Platter Recipe</h1>

            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                2 lbs of chicken wings,
                <br>
                1 lb of beef brisket,
                <br>
                1 cup of BBQ sauce,
                <br>
                1 lb of pork ribs,
                <br>
                1/4 cup of olive oil,
                <br>
                Salt and pepper to taste,
                <br>
                1 tablespoon of smoked paprika,
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <p>
                    Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.
                    Season the chicken wings, pork ribs, and beef brisket with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika.
                    Brush olive oil on the meat to prevent sticking to the grill.
                    Place the meat on the grill and cook until fully cooked and slightly charred. Make sure to turn the
                    meat
                    to
                    cook evenly.
                    During the last few minutes of cooking, baste the meat with BBQ sauce for a flavorful glaze.
                    Remove the meat from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes.
                    Arrange the BBQ platter with the chicken wings, pork ribs, and beef brisket. Serve with additional
                    BBQ
                    sauce
                    on the side.</p>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p><b>Enjoy your delicious BBQ platter!</b></p>
